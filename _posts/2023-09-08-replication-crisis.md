I wonder how much of the "replication crisis" is actually a crisis, rather than science working as it should? Sometimes we forget how far science has come from the Ancient Greeks to The Scientific Revolution. Randomization, a procedure we find so obviously crucial for the unbiased evaluation of an intervention, was only introduced in the middle of the 20th century. Does that mean that science was in a crisis before the implementation of randomization? Our ability to make inferences, in medicine for example, certainly improved drastically with the RCT, but that does not imply that products of science (such as vaccines) were irredeemably untrustworthy before that. We may be quick to conclude that if the system isn't perfect now, then it must be fundamentally broken. Just like how scientists implemented randomization to address selection bias was an example of scientific progress, so may be the examination of the methods and practices of the scientific community leading to biased results. We shouldn't expect scientific methods to have been born perfect, and progress isn't automatic. The "replication crisis" does not necessarily seem like a crisis to me.

 

My next question concerns whether science and the profit-motive and truly irreconcilable. The US government has only been formally funding science for about half a century, largely driven by WWII and the Cold War. Yet there was plenty of science occurring before public money was used to fund science, including that which sparked and fueled the Industrial Revolution. Even today private companies fund a majority (73%) of the US total R&D expenditures. Further, it is not obvious to me that financial COIs are more insidious than intellectual COIs (e.g., wanting to support your favorite theory).
